# Javascript

This is a repository for my JavaScript class assignments. Throughout the course, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript programming language, including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, arrays, objects, functions, and more.  
 
The assignments included in this repository cover various topics, such as control flow, functions, and arrays. Each assignment contains a detailed description of the problem, the solution I came up with, and the output produced by my code.  

Additionally, I will also include a few personal projects that I worked on outside of class to further develop my JavaScript skills. These projects cover topics such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and API integration.  
 
Overall, this repository showcases my progress and growth as a JavaScript programmer, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for other students learning this powerful programming language.
